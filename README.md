1. Stylometry and Text Analysis Project

Used Python to build a model that tries to identify an author or writing style by looking at different parts of the text. Analyzed things like the words used, word lengths, word roots, sentence lengths, and punctuation. The model compares writing samples to see which one is more similar. This helps show how we can guess who wrote a piece based on patterns in their writing.
